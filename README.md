# Using Spinnaker SDK to acquire images and converts them into cv::Mat

## How to run under Linux
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Acquisition
```

## TODOS
- can't show RGB format images(guessing that there's something to do with Nodemap)
- there is an obviously delay(about 200ms), needs to be removed
